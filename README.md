## User Stories

- **Game Enthusiast**

I was eager to try out Tic Tac Toe on a 9x9 grid, especially with the added challenge of a 15-second time cap per move. The larger board promised deeper strategy, and the time pressure only heightened the excitement. 

- **Amateur Player**

Although I initially hesitated, the clear instructions provided on the game's landing page helped me gain more confidence.
I found myself quickly adapting to the fast-paced gameplay, making decisions on the fly and learning to think more strategically under pressure.

## Features

- **The Grid**

The 9x9 grid is dynamically generated, with its visual representation achieved through HTML elements generated by JavaScript code.

- **Score Board**

The Score Board updates each time a player wins, keeping track of the number of wins until the player chooses to exit the game through the end game button.

- **Move Timer**

At the beginning of the game, a timer initiates a countdown from 15 seconds, providing each player with a limited timeframe to make their move. If a player fails to make a move within the allotted 15 seconds, the computer intervenes, making a random move on their behalf.

- **Player Turn**

This feature begins by informing the players of who will move first and continues to update throughout the game, indicating whose turn it is. It automatically updates after each player has made a move.

- **Info Modals**

Their purpose is to provide information to the player when needed, without disrupting the game. Additionally, the game modal also facilitates resetting the game to its initial state through a replay button.

## Landing Page

The landing page serves a dual purpose: it presents a brief history of the game and provides clear instructions to the player.

- **Main Purpose**

Its primary function is to introduce the player to the game and offer concise guidance on gameplay.

## Game Page

The game page presents a streamlined playing layout, providing the player with clear access to all necessary information such as player turn, scoreboard, and time remaining until the next move. At the conclusion of each round, a winner is declared through a popup, and the player is given the option to play again. 

- **Main Purpose**

Essentially, the primary goal is to offer an immersive playing experience and encourage the player to enjoy multiple games with ease.

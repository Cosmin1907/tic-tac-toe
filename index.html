      <p>Game Setup: Play on a 9x9 grid where 'X' and 'O' symbols are alternately placed in empty cells.</p>
      <p>Gameplay: Each player has 15 seconds to make a move. The game continues until one player successfully forms a sequence of four symbols in a row, meeting
        the criteria of horizontal, vertical, diagonal, or anti-diagonal alignment, or until the entire grid is filled
        without a winner, resulting in a draw.</p>
